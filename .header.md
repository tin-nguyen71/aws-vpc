# AWS VPC Terraform module

Terraform module which creates VPC resources on AWS.

## NAT Gateway Scenarios

This module supports three scenarios for creating NAT gateways. Each will be explained in further detail in the corresponding sections.

- One NAT Gateway per subnet (default behavior)
  - `enable_nat_gateway = true`
  - `single_nat_gateway = false`
  - `one_nat_gateway_per_az = false`
- Single NAT Gateway
  - `enable_nat_gateway = true`
  - `single_nat_gateway = true`
  - `one_nat_gateway_per_az = false`
- One NAT Gateway per availability zone
  - `enable_nat_gateway = true`
  - `single_nat_gateway = false`
  - `one_nat_gateway_per_az = true`

If both `single_nat_gateway` and `one_nat_gateway_per_az` are set to `true`, then `single_nat_gateway` takes precedence.

### One NAT Gateway per subnet (default)

The module will determine the number of NAT Gateways to create based on the private subnet.

### Single NAT Gateway

If `single_nat_gateway = true`, then all private subnets will route their Internet traffic through this single NAT gateway. The NAT gateway will be placed in the first public subnet in your `public_subnets` block.

### One NAT Gateway per availability zone

If `one_nat_gateway_per_az = true` and `single_nat_gateway = false`, then the module will place one NAT gateway in each availability zone you specify in `var.azs`. There are some requirements around using this feature flag:

- The variable `var.azs` **must** be specified.
- The number of public subnet CIDR blocks specified in `public_subnets` **must** be greater than or equal to the number of availability zones specified in `var.azs`. This is to ensure that each NAT Gateway has a dedicated public subnet to deploy to.

## VPC Flow Log

VPC Flow Log allows to capture IP traffic for a specific network interface (ENI), subnet, or entire VPC. This module supports enabling or disabling VPC Flow Logs for entire VPC. If you need to have VPC Flow Logs for subnet or ENI, you have to manage it outside of this module with [aws_flow_log resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/flow_log.html).

### VPC Flow Log Examples

By default `file_format` is `plain-text`. You can also specify `parquet` to have logs written in Apache Parquet format.

```
flow_log_file_format = "parquet"
```

## Conditional creation

```hcl
# This VPC will not be created
module "vpc" {
  source = "./aws-vpc"

  create_vpc = false
  # ... omitted
}
```
## Transit Gateway Scenarios

If `create_vpc_attachment` and `transit_gateway_id` not empty, then all private subnets will be configured with routes to the transit gateway.
